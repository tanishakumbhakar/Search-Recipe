# Search-Recipe

In this project, I have created a useful recipe search engine web page which uses api from www.recipepuppy.com and gives the results in a user friendly manner.Bad data and bad user behaviours are also handled in an attempt to reduce hacking.

## Motivation
The motivation behind creating this project was to understand the principles of REST, API and write code in JavaScript to interface with other systems in web pages.

## Tech/framework used
<b>Built with</b>
- HTML
- CSS
- jQuery
- AJAX

## Features
- One can search a recipe with the given ingredients.This is needed since many times we do not know the right recipe that can be made with the ingredients.
- If one remembers a dish name, one can also enter some keywords which the dish contains and all the dishes containing the keyword specified are displayed.
- On clicking the image displayed as well as the heading, the webpage containing the detailed description of the recipe is displayed.
